% CO2 Modeling & Carbon Storage Consulting: Company Work Plan
% Carbon Modeling Team
% February 2, 2026

## Executive Summary
I provide end-to-end CO2 storage modeling and decision support for CCS developers, operators, and technology companies. My work is focused on answering the questions that drive real project decisions: injectivity and pressure management, plume migration and containment, trapping and permanence accounting, operational optimization, and MRV-ready model packages.

My approach is practical and transparent: I document assumptions, quantify uncertainty where it matters, and deliver reproducible model packages that your technical team can run, review, and audit.

## Core Capabilities

### Injectivity and Pressure Management
I can evaluate whether target injection rates are feasible under pressure and fracture constraints, and I can recommend operating strategies that manage pressure buildup.

#### What I deliver
- Pressure vs time (and spatial pressure footprints)
- Injectivity curves and constraint exceedance summaries
- Recommendations for injection rate ramps, shut-in logic, and guardrails

### Plume Migration and Containment
I can predict the evolution of the free-phase CO2 plume and pressure perturbation over operational (years) to post-injection (decades) time scales.

#### What I deliver
- Plume footprint maps/volumes through time
- Sensitivity to heterogeneity, anisotropy, salinity, and thermal effects
- Containment narratives tied to specific model assumptions

### Trapping and Permanence Accounting
I can quantify CO2 partitioning into mobile/free-phase, residually trapped, dissolved, and (when applicable) mineralized fractions, and track how those fractions evolve over time.

#### What I deliver
- Mass partitioning curves and mass-balance reporting
- KPIs aligned with engineering and permanence reporting needs
- Uncertainty ranges tied to key parameters (e.g., relative permeability, residual saturations)

### Wells, Schedules, and Operational Controls
I can model coupled well behavior and operational controls, including multi-well scenarios, water-alternating-gas (WAG), and brine extraction to manage pressure.

#### What I deliver
- Schedule design and comparative scenario runs
- Constraint management (fracture pressure limits, minimum pressure, BHP limits)
- Well-by-well and field-level KPIs (rates, cumulative mass, constraint utilization)

### Reactive Transport and Mineralization
I can include reactive transport and geochemistry when project goals require mineralization potential and time-scale estimates, supporting defensible permanence claims.

#### What I deliver
- Geochemistry setup (database selection, reactions, kinetics, minerals)
- CO2 partitioning including mineralized mass
- Mineral formation diagnostics and consistent mass-balance checks

### MRV-Ready Modeling Packages
I can produce auditable, repeatable modeling deliverables suitable for internal governance and regulatory-facing workflows.

#### What I deliver
- Versioned model package: inputs, parameters, run scripts, and run logs
- Standard QA/QC checks (mass balance, timestep/solver stability, boundary-condition audits)
- Standard plots and summary tables for each scenario

### Risk and Uncertainty Framing
I can translate modeling into decision risk bounds by running sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that are right-sized to the business decision.

#### What I deliver
- Sensitivity studies to identify “what changes the answer”
- Probabilistic envelopes (e.g., P10/P50/P90) when warranted
- Clear interpretation of risk drivers and monitoring implications

## Engagement Packages (How Companies Typically Buy This Work)

- Well configuration(s) and injection schedule(s)
- Pressure constraint evaluation and plume/trapping diagnostics
- Reproducible run package with standardized plots

### Package C — Operations Optimization (4–8 Weeks)
**Goal:** optimize operating strategy under constraints.

#### Deliverables
- Comparative schedule design (including WAG and brine extraction where relevant)
- KPIs tied to objectives (injected mass, plume footprint, constraint utilization)
- Operational recommendations and contingency scenarios

### Package D — Reactive Transport & Mineralization (6–12 Weeks)
**Goal:** quantify mineralization potential and time scales; support permanence claims.

#### Deliverables
- Chemistry and kinetic model setup with documented assumptions
- CO2 mass partitioning including mineralized fraction
- Sensitivity/uncertainty bounds focused on reaction kinetics and surface area

### Package E — MRV-Ready Model Library (Ongoing)
**Goal:** keep the model auditable and up-to-date as new data and decisions arrive.

#### Deliverables
- Scenario library with versioned inputs/outputs and change logs
- Standard QA/QC and reporting artifacts per update
- “Decision snapshots” that show what changed and why

## Delivery Workflow (How I Execute Projects)

### 1) Data Intake and Assumptions Register
I start with a structured data checklist and produce an assumptions register that is explicit about what is known, what is inferred, and what is uncertain.

### 2) Model Build and Verification
I build the model to the appropriate fidelity for the decision at hand and verify the fundamentals (initial conditions, boundary conditions, conservation, and solver robustness).

### 3) Calibration and Reasonableness Checks
When calibration targets exist (pressure, flow, temperature, chemistry), I use them. When they don’t, I document reasonableness checks and parameter ranges.

### 4) Sensitivity and Uncertainty
I run targeted sensitivities first. If decision risk requires it, I expand to probabilistic runs and report results as risk bounds.

### 5) Decision-Ready Reporting
I deliver outputs that directly answer project questions, with concise interpretation, traceable assumptions, and reproducible artifacts.

## Quality, Reproducibility, and Governance

### Reproducible Model Packages
Each delivery includes a runnable package with pinned software versions (where possible), run scripts, and a clear directory structure.

### QA/QC Standards
I apply consistent checks across scenarios:
- Mass-balance and conservation checks
- Nonphysical state checks (e.g., saturations, pressures)
- Boundary-condition and unit sanity checks
- Solver performance and timestep stability review

### Transparent Documentation
I keep documentation lightweight but complete: assumptions register, parameter tables, and a change log that shows what changed between versions.

## Inputs I Typically Request

### Minimum Inputs (Screening)
- Basic stratigraphy and depth intervals
- Representative porosity/permeability ranges (and anisotropy assumptions)
- Temperature and pressure gradients; salinity
- Planned wells, injection rates, and operational constraints
- Fracture gradient / maximum allowable pressure criteria

### Additional Inputs (Site-Scale and MRV)
- Geologic framework model and property grids
- Well completions/perforations and operating limits
- Monitoring data (pressure, flow, tracer/chemistry, seismic) when available
- Regulatory reporting requirements and internal QA expectations

## Next Steps
1. I can start with a 30–60 minute technical scoping call to align on objectives, constraints, and available data.
2. I will provide a short data checklist and a fixed-scope proposal for a pilot (typically Rapid Screening or Site Concept Model).
3. Once scope is agreed, I deliver the first decision-ready results early, then iterate with weekly touchpoints.
