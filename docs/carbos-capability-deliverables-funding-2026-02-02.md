## Summary
I provide computational modeling and analysis for subsurface CO2 storage and carbon management using PFLOTRAN-based workflows. I deliver reproducible simulation packages, operational scenarios with constraints, and decision-ready outputs that directly support engineering decisions, project planning, and technical review.

## Capabilities

### Multiphase CO2 Flow (CO2–Water / SCO2)
I can model CO2 injection and long-term evolution with the physics needed for storage decisions.

#### What I can do
- Injection scenarios with pressure buildup and plume migration
- Buoyancy-driven flow and containment behavior
- Salinity and thermal variants where they materially affect results

### Wells and Operations
I can represent coupled wells and operational controls and evaluate performance under real constraints.

#### What I can do
- Well injection/production scheduling (including WAG and brine extraction strategies)
- Constraint evaluation (fracture pressure limits, minimum pressure, BHP limits)
- Well performance summaries and field-level KPIs

### Reactive Transport and Mineralization
When permanence claims and geochemistry matter, I can include reactive transport to quantify mineralization potential and time scales.

#### What I can do
- Couple flow, transport, and geochemistry for CO2 partitioning
- Track CO2 into mobile/free-phase, dissolved, and mineralized fractions
- Produce mass-balance-based KPIs with clearly stated assumptions and limits

### Post-Processing, KPIs, and Reporting
I can turn raw model output into decision-ready plots and tables with consistent formatting.

#### What I can do
- Automated plots for pressure, plume footprint proxies, and well behavior
- CO2 mass partitioning summaries through time
- Clear, reviewable documentation and run logs

### Reproducibility and QA/QC
I build deliverables that are designed to be rerun, audited, and extended.

#### What I can do
- Provide a reproducible run package (inputs, run instructions, and standard plots)
- Apply QA/QC checks (mass balance, timestep stability, sanity checks)
- Maintain versioning and change tracking for iterative projects

## Deliverables
Deliverables scale with data availability and project goals. I can start small for fast insight and expand to site-scale and permanence analyses.

### Deliverable Set A — Rapid Screening (2–4 Weeks)

#### Deliverables
- Screening models sized to the available information (injectivity, pressure buildup, and first-order plume behavior)
- Sensitivity results for the parameters that drive the answer (e.g., permeability, relative permeability, salinity/temperature assumptions)
- A concise PDF report summarizing assumptions, results, and recommended next steps

### Deliverable Set B — Site Concept Model (6–12 Weeks)

#### Deliverables
- Site-scale model setup (initialization, boundary conditions, stratigraphy/heterogeneity representation)
- One or more well configurations and schedules with constraint checks
- Decision outputs: pressure envelopes, plume evolution, and trapping diagnostics
- Reproducible model package with run instructions and standardized plots

### Deliverable Set C — Mineralization and Permanence Analysis (6–12 Weeks)

#### Deliverables
- Chemistry configuration (species/minerals/reaction rates and database selection)
- CO2 partitioning vs time (mobile gas vs dissolved vs mineralized)
- Permanence KPIs suitable for technical narratives, with explicit assumptions and limitations

### Deliverable Set D — MRV-Ready Model Package (Ongoing)

#### Deliverables
- Standard QA/QC checklist and run log per update
- Versioned scenario library and consistent reporting format
- Monitoring implications when desired (measurements that most constrain plume/pressure)

## Inputs Needed

### Minimum Inputs (for Rapid Screening)
- Basic geology/stratigraphy (layer depths/thicknesses)
- Representative porosity/permeability ranges and boundary condition assumptions
- Temperature gradient, salinity (or brine composition when available), and initial pressures
- Target injection rates/masses, well geometry/perforations, and operational constraints (fracture gradient/pressure limits)

### Additional Inputs (for Site-Scale and Calibration)
- Property grids or geologic framework model (if available)
- Monitoring data (pressure/flow/chemistry) when calibration or history matching is in scope
- Any internal or regulatory reporting requirements that the deliverable must satisfy

## Expected Funding (Typical Ranges)
Final budgets depend on scope, data quality, and required uncertainty analysis. Typical research/industry-funded ranges are:

- **Small / pilot (screening):** USD **$25k–$75k**
  - Rapid feasibility: injectivity/pressure/plume first-pass and short report.

- **Medium (site concept model):** USD **$75k–$250k**
  - Client-specific model build, multiple scenarios, documented workflows, decision plots.

- **Large (site + optimization + mineralization + uncertainty):** USD **$250k–$750k+**
  - Multi-scenario operations evaluation, reactive transport/permanence analysis, uncertainty quantification, and MRV-ready packaging.

If you prefer grant-style budgeting, I can also express the plan as work packages (WP1–WP4) with milestones and a not-to-exceed cap.

## Timeline and Milestones

### Weeks 1–2
- Data intake and assumptions register
- Baseline model setup and verification checks

### Weeks 3–4
- Screening scenarios and sensitivities
- First decision-ready report

### Weeks 5–8
- Site model expansion, well schedules, and constraint evaluation
- Decision outputs and reproducible package refinement

### Weeks 9–12 (When Mineralization Is In Scope)
- Reactive transport/mineralization coupling
- Permanence KPIs and uncertainty bounds focused on kinetics assumptions

## Why This Is Valuable
This work converts site data and operational goals into testable scenarios with traceable assumptions, quantitative KPIs, and repeatable simulation packages—making it easier to de-risk operations and communicate results to both technical stakeholders and decision makers.
