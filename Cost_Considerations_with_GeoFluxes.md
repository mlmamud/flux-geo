# Cost Considerations with GeoFluxes  
## A Reproducible Framework for Subsurface Flow, Transport, and Reactive Modeling

---

## Overview

GeoFluxes projects combine **physics-based subsurface simulation**, **custom scientific workflow development**, **reproducible computational execution**, **automated postprocessing**, and **audit-ready technical reporting**. Cost structures reflect not only model development, but also the **scientific expertise, risk management, and review readiness** required for high-stakes subsurface decision-making.

In the U.S. consulting and research-services market, pricing for work of this nature is driven primarily by:

- Technical and numerical complexity  
- Domain expertise across flow, transport, and geochemistry  
- Compliance, traceability, and reproducibility requirements  
- Iterative scenario development and stakeholder review cycles  

Pricing is therefore based on **effort, expertise, and risk mitigation**, rather than code volume alone.

## Typical Independent Consultant Rate Bands (USD)

Indicative hourly rate ranges for comparable GeoFluxes-style work include:

- **Generalist scientific modelers / early-career developers:**  
  **$75–$125 per hour**

- **Senior subsurface modelers and scientific software developers**  
  (PFLOTRAN, FEHM, MODFLOW, reactive transport, uncertainty analysis):  
  **$150–$250 per hour**

- **Specialized boutique consultants or high-compliance, fast-turnaround projects:**  
  **$250–$350+ per hour**

Actual rates depend on project urgency, regulatory exposure, and review burden.

## Practical Pricing Approach

A defensible and transparent pricing strategy for GeoFluxes projects typically includes:

1. **Effort estimation**
   - Commonly **150–400 hours** depending on scope, physics, and review cycles  

2. **Agreed hourly rate**
   - Based on expertise level and compliance expectations  

3. **Contingency allocation (15–30%)**
   - Numerical stability and solver tuning  
   - Scenario refinement and scope evolution  
   - Stakeholder feedback and review iterations  
   - Documentation and QA/QC refinement  

4. **Optional post-delivery support**
   - Typically **$2k–$8k per month**
   - Covers model updates, reruns, data assimilation, and technical support

## Cost Drivers and Scaling Factors

Key drivers influencing GeoFluxes project cost include:

- Number of modeled scenarios and operational strategies  
- Dimensionality (2D vs 3D) and grid resolution  
- Degree of heterogeneity and geologic complexity  
- Coupling of flow, transport, and geochemistry  
- Extent of sensitivity, calibration, and uncertainty analysis  
- Frequency of sponsor review and revision cycles  

Transparent cost scaling ensures sponsors understand how added rigor translates into added value.

## Value Proposition

GeoFluxes pricing reflects more than simulation execution. It includes:

- **Deep domain expertise** across multiple subsurface simulators  
- **Risk reduction** through reproducible, traceable, and auditable workflows  
- **Decision-ready outputs** suitable for engineering, risk, and regulatory contexts  
- **Consistency across scales and modeling approaches**  

GeoFluxes delivers **defensible science**, not just model outputs.

---

## Competitive Positioning

Compared to ad hoc modeling or solver-specific consulting, GeoFluxes offers:

- Integrated multi-physics workflows  
- Consistent QA/QC across tools and scenarios  
- Faster iteration with reduced rework  
- Clear uncertainty communication  

This reduces downstream decision risk and long-term project cost.

---

## Summary

GeoFluxes enables sponsors to invest in **transparent, reproducible, and scientifically defensible subsurface modeling**. Funding scales naturally with project ambition, physics complexity, and uncertainty-management needs—allowing organizations to balance **cost, rigor, and decision confidence**.
